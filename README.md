# Ipfo

Ipfo is python script that use your api key of  [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io) to gather informations about IP(s) or ASN(s).

The Full report option and all options that related to ASN, are under development and since my account in [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io)
is free account, So there maybe problems.
If you found any problem, please report it. Also, anybody who has paid account, if he/she can, please share his/her API key
with me, then I can make this script better

AS THIS SCRIPT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT(FULL REPORT + ASN OPTIONS), SO IF YOU FOUND ANY PROBLEM, REPORT IT.
